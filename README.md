## Notes

While building the Sea Monster Crowdfunding application, I improved my skills with:

- Parsing and working with JSON data
- DOM manipulation and dynamic element creation
- CSS Flexbox for responsive design
- JavaScript array methods
- Handling events and state with buttons

-Maintaining clean and organized code while implementing multiple features was a key challenge that ultimately strengthened my problem-solving ability.
